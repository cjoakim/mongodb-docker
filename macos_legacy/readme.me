# MacOS Legacy Files

Due to the complexity of installing mongodb locally on macOS,
and setting system open-file limits, I have abandoned using
local manual installations of mongodb community edition with homebrew.

Therefore, the creation of this reusable repo as the foundation
for my future mongodb projects.
